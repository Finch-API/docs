## Payroll Product Overview
Payroll is essential for any business, which makes payroll software one of the most valuable and reliable sources of truth for employment data. Finch's Pay product provides a comprehensive view into an employer's payroll history, from company payments down to specific employee pay statement details. Finch helps classify the data returned to make it easy to understand, with specific types for earnings, taxes, benefits, and more.

Finch's Payroll product is comprised of 2 read-only API endpoints.

### Payment
The [`/payment`](/api-reference/2-payroll/payment) API endpoint provides the ability to view company payroll payments. This endpoint shows aggregate information about a company's payruns and links to the individual employee pay statements generated from a payrun.

### Pay Statement
The [`/pay-statement`](/api-reference/2-payroll/pay-statement) API endpoint provides detailed information about individual pay stubs for each employee. You can use tax and deduction line items to verify that deductions and contributions have been applied, view gross and net pay to determine year-to-date earnings, and view all the details of exactly what goes into an employee's paycheck.
