Currently, only the `data_sync_all` job type is supported, which will enqueue a job to re-sync all data for a connection. `data_sync_all` has a concurrency limit of 1 job at a time per connection. This means that if this endpoint is called while a job is already in progress for this connection, Finch will return the `job_id` of the job that is currently in progress. Finch allows a fixed window rate limit of 1 forced refresh per hour per connection.

This endpoint is available for *Scale* tier customers as an add-on. To request access to this endpoint, please contact your Finch account manager.
