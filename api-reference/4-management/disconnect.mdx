Deletion is based on both the employer and provider of the `access_token` used to call this endpoint, and will also delete all tokens with the same employer/provider pair. Other tokens for the same employer, but connected to a different provider, require a separate call.

We require applications to implement the Disconnect endpoint for billing and security purposes.
