**Availability: Automated and Assisted providers**

If the same request is made more than once with the same `benefit_type` and `description`, a new item will not be created. Finch will instead return the `benefit_id` of the existing item.

This is a live request to the provider. Latencies may vary from seconds to minutes depending on the provider and number of benefits.
