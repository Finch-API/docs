title: "Set Up Finch Connect"
---

Now that your application is [registered with Finch](/docs/Implementation-Guide/Connect/Create-Account), it's time to integrate Finch Connect into your application's frontend. Finch Connect is the user-facing authentication flow that allows your users to securely input their employment system credentials to establish a connection with their provider. This prerequisite step is crucial before obtaining access tokens to make API requests. 

Finch Connect is configurable with the following parameters:

Parameter | Required | Description
---------|----------|---------
 `client_id` | true | Your `client_id`, a unique identifier for your application.
 `products` | true | A space-separated list of permissions your application is requesting access to. See [Product Permissions](https://developer.tryfinch.com/docs/reference/e68b00055f1d8-permissions) for a list of valid permissions.
 `redirect_uri` | redirect only | The URI your user is redirected to after successfully granting your application access to their system. This value must match one of your application's configured [redirect URIs](/docs/Implementation-Guide/Connect/Create-Account#redirect-uris).
 `state` | optional | An optional value included as a query parameter in the response back to your application. This value is often used to identify a user and/or prevent cross-site request forgery.
 `payroll_provider` | optional | An optional parameter that allows you to bypass the provider selection screen by providing a valid `provider_id` from our list of [Providers](/docs/Integrations/Providers).
 `sandbox` | false | An optional value that allows users to switch on sandbox mode to connect to test environments. Allowed values: `finch` and `provider`. For more information, read our [testing guide](docs/Implementation-Guide/Test/Testing-Plan).
 `manual` | false | An optional value which when set to true displays both [Automated and Assisted Providers](/docs/Integrations/Integration-Types) on the selection screen.
 `category` | false | The category of integrations your applications would like to expose. Currently only `hris` is supported. If no category is provided, defaults to `hris`.

Finch provides two options to setup Finch Connect: [Redirect](#redirect-finch-connect) or [Embedded](#embedded-finch-connect).

## Redirect to Finch Connect

In this method of integrating Finch Connect, your application redirects your user's browser to Finch Connect hosted by Finch on `https://connect.tryfinch.com`. After a successful connection, Finch Connect will redirect your user back to a URI you specified (`redirect_uri`) with a short-lived authorization `code`.
        
```bash
https://connect.tryfinch.com/authorize?
&client_id=fdc8f543-bfb2-4463-883b-fa234106ca9d
&products=company directory individual employment
&redirect_uri=https://example.com
```

The redirect authorization flow consists of four steps:

1. **Open Finch Connect** — Your application redirects your user's browser to Finch Connect to initiate the authorization flow.
1. **Obtain consent** — Finch Connect prompts your user to log in to their employment system and grant your application access to the permissions you are requesting.
1. **Retrieve the authorization code** — If your user successfully connects and grants your application access to their system, Finch Connect will redirect their browser to a specified `redirect_uri` with a short-lived authorization `code`.
1. **Exchange the code for an access token** — Before sending API requests, your application will exchange the short-lived code for a long-lived `access_token` that represents your application's access to your user's employment system.

## Embedded Finch Connect

If you are using a [Finch-provided SDK](/docs/Developer-Resources/SDKs#frontend-sdks) (recommended), you are essentially embedding the Finch Connect screen into your application. The user will remain entirely on your application throughout the entire process. When the `onSuccess` event is called by the SDK, simply pass the `code` to your internal callback endpoint as a query parameter. You will not need to set up a Redirect URI because the entire flow is already self-contained in your app.

        
## Implementing Finch Connect to your application


1. **Choose your preferred flow**:  Finch provides several [Frontend SDKs](/docs/Developer-Resources/SDKs#frontend-sdks) for easy integration. Select the SDK that best suits your application's technology stack. Otherwise, you can use the Redirect flow. 
    - [React SDK](https://github.com/Finch-API/react-connect): If you're using React as your frontend framework, use the React SDK. Import the Finch Connect component and include it in your application. You can find examples and usage instructions in the SDK documentation or continue to follow this tutorial.
      - `npm install --save @tryfinch/react-connect`
      - `yarn add @tryfinch/react-connect`

    - JavaScript SDK: If you're using a different frontend framework or vanilla JavaScript, use the pure JavaScript SDK. Include the Finch Connect library in your application, either by adding a script tag to your HTML file or by importing it as a module.
      - `<script src="https://prod-cdn.tryfinch.com/v1/connect.js"></script>`
        > Since Finch Connect is an iFrame that requires interactivity, the HTML page that is loading Finch Connect **must be served from a server**. If the page is hosted statically, Finch Connect will not work properly.
    - [Redirect Flow](#redirect-to-finch-connect): The redirect flow is helpful in instances where you do not have a user interface (such as a link in an email) or you prefer to redirect in order to not host the authorization experience yourself.

2. **Configure Finch Connect**: Every flow requires you to configure Finch Connect with your unique `client_id`. You can find this `client_id` in your Finch Developer Dashboard. Additionally, set the `redirect_uri` parameter to the URL where users will be redirected after completing the authentication flow (also set in the Finch Developer Dashboard).

<CodeBlock>
```js React
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useFinchConnect } from "react-finch-connect";

const App = () => {
  const [code, setCode] = useState(null);

  const onSuccess = ({ code }) => setCode(code);
  const onError = ({ errorMessage }) => console.error(errorMessage);
  const onClose = () => console.log("User exited Finch Connect");

  // 1. Initialize Finch Connect
  const { open } = useFinchConnect({
    clientId: "<your-client-id>",
    products: ["company", "directory", "individual", "employment", "payment", "pay_statement"],
    onSuccess,
    onError,
    onClose,
  });

  // ...
};
```
```html Javascript
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      const onSuccess = ({code}) => {
        // exchange code for access token via your server
      }
      const onError = ({ errorMessage }) => {
        console.error(errorMessage);
      }
      const onClose = () => {
        console.log('Connect closed');
      }
      const connect = FinchConnect.initialize({
        clientId: '<your-client-id>',
        products: ['company', 'directory', "individual", "employment", "payment", "pay_statement"],
        sandbox: false,
        manual: false,
        onSuccess,
        onError,
        onClose,
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```        
</CodeBlock>

3. **Implement the authentication flow**: Add a button or a link in your application that triggers the Finch Connect flow. Users will click this button or link to start the authentication process.

<CodeBlock>
```js React
const App = () => {
  // ...

  // 2. Display Finch Connect
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => open()}>
      Open Finch Connect
    </button>
  );
};
```
```html Javascript
<html>
  <body>
    <button id="connect-button">Open Finch Connect</button>
    <script>
      const button = document.getElementById('connect-button');

      const connect = FinchConnect.initialize({
        ...
      });
      button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        connect.open();
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
</CodeBlock>
        
4. **Listen for events**: Finch Connect emits events that your application should listen for to handle the different stages of the authentication process. The two most important events are `onSuccess` and `onError`.
    1. `onSuccess`: This event is triggered when the user completes the authentication process. It returns an authorization `code` that you will use to obtain an `access_token` in the next step. Pass this authorization `code` securely and temporarily to the access token exchange function.
    2. `onError`: This event is triggered if there's an issue during the authentication process. Your application should handle this error gracefully, either by displaying an error message to the user or retrying the authentication flow.
    3. `onClose`: This event is triggered when a user exits the Finch Connect model, either by closing the modal or clicking outside the modal.

## Bypass the provider selection screen

The provider selection screen can be skipped by providing a valid [provider_id](/docs/Integrations/Providers) in the `payroll_provider` option while opening Finch Connect.

Bypassing the provider selection screen can remove user friction by skipping extra steps, avoiding wrong providers, and enabling custom integration pages. 

For more information about bypassing the provider selection screen, refer to the [Improve Finch Connect Conversion](docs/Implementation-Guide/Optimize/Increase-Employer-Adoption) in the Optimize section of the Implementation Guide.
