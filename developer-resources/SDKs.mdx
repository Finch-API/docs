## Frontend SDKs

Finch's frontend SDKs allow you to [embed Finch Connect](https://developer.tryfinch.com/docs/documentation/k6gz5zkt9vaen-set-up-finch-connect#embedded-finch-connect) into your application, enabling you to provide a seamless integration experience for your users. Take a look at our repositories below:

## Backend SDKs

Finch maintains SDKs in several popular languages to make it easy to integrate with Finch APIs. These SDKs are regularly updated for breaking and non-breaking API changes. In addition to installation and quickstart information, each repository contains an `api.md` that documents available methods and data models.
